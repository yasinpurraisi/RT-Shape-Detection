# Real-Time Shape Detection

This project is a real-time shape detection application using OpenCV. It captures video from your webcam, processes each frame to detect geometric shapes (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle), and displays the results with labeled contours.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam
- Binary image processing for robust contour detection
- Shape detection using contour approximation
- Labels detected shapes directly on the video feed

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
